# TCP Chat Room
A secure socket programming solution for a chat server application and client, developed in C.

# Introduction
We propose to implement a secure socket programming solution for a chat server application. This server will facilitate real-time communication between multiple clients while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality through SSL/TLS encryption. Additionally, we aim to incorporate several advanced features to enhance the functionality and security of the chat server. 

## Features
The chat server will allow multiple clients to connect simultaneously and engage in real-time text-based communication. Clients will be able to send and receive messages in a secure manner, ensuring that their conversations remain confidential and tamper-proof. 

The following are the salient features of this implementation

1. SSL Implementation
1. User Authentication
1. Persistent Storage
1. User Presence Detection
1. Message Buffer Management
1. Command Parsing
